# OverlappingEllipses
Python assignment from course DSC430 - grade 100%

Overlapping Ellipses
An ellipse is a curve in a plane surrounding two focal points such that the sum of the distances to the two focal points is constant for every point on the curve.  – Wikipedia.
 
In this assignment you will use a Monte Carlo Simulation to estimate the overlap between two Ellipses.
The assignments is divided into 4 parts:
1.	Ellipse Class
2.	Structure Chart
3.	Implementation
4.	Unit Testing
may also be defined as the set of points such that the ratio of the distance of each point on the curve from a given point (called a focus or focal point) to the distance from that same point on the curve to a given line (called the directrix) is a constant. 

An ellipse may also be defined analytically as the set of points for each of which the sum of its distances to two foci is a fixed number. 


Part 1: Ellipse Class
A.	Write a class to capture the necessary information of an ellipse.
B.	Write code to thoroughly test your implementation of the ellipse class including:
a.	A constructor that accepts no variables.
b.	A constructor that accepts all appropriate variables.
c.	Setting and getting the appropriate variables.
d.	A function that returns the area of the ellipse
e.	A function that returns the circumference of the ellipse.



Part 2: Structure Chart
Using the top-down strategy discussed in class, produce a structure chart to capture the necessary steps for computing the overlap of two ellipses using the Monte Carlo Technique.
A.	Each block of the chart should capture the requirements of a function.
B.	Label each edge with the input and output of the function, similar to the examples given in class.

NOTE: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT YOUR SOLUTION UNTIL YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM AND HAVE MAPPED OUT YOUR SOLUTION.

 
Part 3: Implementation
Implement your solution described by your structure chart.  Your function should accept two Ellipse objects (defined in part 1) and return the area of their overlap.  Use a Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the overlap.  If they do not overlap, return 0.


 
Part 4: Unit Testing
For this part, you will thoroughly test your implementation.  For EVERY function, beginning with the lowest level functions:
A.	Print the name of the function.
B.	Print the doctstring of the function.
C.	Print the rationale for the test (e.g. “Testing when a point falls within an Ellipse.”)
D.	Print the specific input used to evaluate that rationale.
E.	Print the result.
F.	Repeat C – E until all relevant cases are tested for that function.
